# Sunset Impression

Credit: Andy Eng

Description: Simple generated skyline with accompanying sunset slider.

Randomness: This scene generates a ground with varying peaks to simulate realistic hills. Buildings are placed on the ground at varying locations, I chose to make the generated buildings tall as the most noteworthy buildings in my inspiration image are tall. 

Reactivity: By sliding the mouse up and down, the user can manipulate the sun. At different heights, the sun lights the scene differently, causing the colors of the scene to change. Since this is a sunset scene, the most effective way for the user to experience the sunset is to control it themselves. 

Artist statement: The effect I was trying to create is the serene nature of a sunset over the ocean. I think that I did achieve this effect, although it is extremely simple due to the nature of the source image I chose. If I were to add more detail to the image, I believe that it could visually improve, but it could suffer from overcomplicating when the original intent was simplicity.
